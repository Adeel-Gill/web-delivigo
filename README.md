All of us eat – two to five times a day. delivigo is the world’s most advanced mobile interface for getting great food with the push of a button. Delivigo combines a clean, smooth app with a world-class food delivery service and it lets its users order their meal to be delivered, have it as takeaway, or to be eaten at the restaurant. Food is an experience. Delivigo guarantees it’s an excellent one – starting from the moment the user picks a restaurant and builds their order to getting it delivered to their location. As reliably and fast as possible. In 1–2 years, the home screens of our smart devices have one icon for getting food. Delivigo is going to be that icon. As Delivigo is the world’s most advanced mobile interface for getting great food, couriers working with us need to be the best as well.
